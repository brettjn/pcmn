Lets create a clone of the arcade video game classic Pacman.  Lets use the cursor movement arrow keys instead of a joystick for control. Lets create a .venv python evnironment and load the library pygame to utilize for building the game. The python game file will be named pcmn.py



Problem:

I ran into this error after playing the game for maybe 20 seconds.

python3 pcmn.py 
pygame 2.6.1 (SDL 2.28.4, Python 3.12.3)

    distances.sort()
TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'Direction' and 'Direction'


The game ends saying I one when there are still 4 dots left on the playing field.

(Note there are some movement issues where it gets stuck, but leave that for possible future fix, this is just a demonstration of AI code generation capabilities.)
